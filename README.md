# This program will scan multiple targets at once for open ports and grab banners. You can modify the code to scan as many ports as desired, as well as manipulate the timeout. IP address and domain names are acceptable input. If a domain name is entered, it will be converted to an IP address. Only open ports will show up when running a scan.
